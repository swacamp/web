### Freitag: A new way of mapping sociotechnical architectures

Sociotechnical architectures aim at the interaction between people and technology in 
software architectures. Domain-driven Design is a very popular approach to this way of thinking. 
Context Maps have been an integral part of Domain-driven Design for many years and they 
helped many organization in cartographing their application and organizational landscapes. 
This talk will build up on the ideas of context maps and will propose a new level for 
mapping sociotechnical architectures. This approach will show different layers / perspectives 
for looking at the architecture of (systems of) systems. In addition I will show which patterns 
fit into which layer and reuse some of the context maps patterns but I will also show new patterns, 
that have not been described in the classic Domain-driven Design books.

### Samstag: Beyond the hype: A practical look at models of self-organization

Self-organization has become one of the most popular buzz words in the business world. 
Many people talk about it, but when you ask for details, benefits and purpose, 
you often get vague answers or blank stares in return. What is the point of models of 
self-organization like Holacracy and Sociocracy, aside from name-dropping in meetings 
to sound smart and forward-thinking? 

The idea of self-organized teams has been around for quite a while, and even the currently 
popular models of self-organization are a lot older than you might think. Why is it then 
that they have become so popular over the last few years? More and more companies attempt 
to implement agile work methods, to work more closely aligned with user needs and to drive 
their innovation efforts in general. At the same time, many organizations feel the 
new workflows clashing with their established structures and their work culture. 
Can these models of self-organization be a possible solution to this conflict? 
And if so, what might such a solution look like?

How can we look beyond the hype and the assorted myths about self-organization? 
My take is that we should forget about organizational charts for the moment and instead 
focus on more practical matters: Meeting formats and culture, responsibilities 
and decision making. This is where Holacracy and Sociocracy tackle the conflict of 
traditional hierarchy and self-organized, agile teams. I would like to share some 
thoughts and principles as well as my personal experience with self-organization 
with you, to facilitate discussion and the exchange of ideas.
