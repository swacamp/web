This year we are proud to have Cecilia Maria Zannini moderating SwaCamp.
                                  
<i>Cecilia Maria Zannini</i> is a Munich based Agile Coach for Connexxo. From the moment she first heard about Agility and Scrum in 2012, she was stunned and ready to talk about it to anyone who would listen. From 2015 she began training others, and that's where she started to get passionate about coaching. She believes that Scrum and Agility are the revolution the world needs to give birth to products, philosophies, companies, and eggplant parmigiana.
