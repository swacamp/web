## Code of Conduct

**TL;DR:** Be excellent towards each other.

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the 
following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. 
We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

#### Need Help?

After the registration, you will receive mails containing contact information.
Just talk to us - also during the event - whenever you got questions or problems. 

#### The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, 
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 
We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. 
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, 
Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled 
from the conference *without a refund* at the discretion of the conference organisers.
